# Dive by Nathan Ludberg
## IASC 1P04
Welcome to the website for my Twine Game, created for the course IASC 1P04 at Brock University

Dive is a short exploration game taking place in the deep dark depths of the ocean, inspired by the game *Subnautica*. In this game you will have to explore and uncover things that lurk in the darkness of the unknown, as well as try to stay alive. I hope you enjoy my first ever Twine game.
